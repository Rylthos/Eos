# Examples

# Basic Triangle
Provides a basic setup with shaders and Vertices
for rendering a triangle to the screen

# Indexed Triangle
Similar to Basic Triangle however includes indices when
creating the Mesh

# Basic Descriptor Sets
Provides a setup for using Descriptor Sets to pass data
to the shaders

# Events
Provides a basic setup for receiving events

# Moving Square
Shows a basic Combination of Rendering, Events, and descriptor Sets
to provide a moving square on the screen

# Snake
A more advanced version of moving square providing a working
implementation of Snake

# Textures
An example showing how to read in an image and render it to
a mesh

# 3DCube
An example showing how to modify the RenderPass to provide a
depth buffer, along with a free camera

# Compute
An example showing how to create a compute shader and read/write
to buffers that the shader has access too

# Compute Texture
An example combing textures and compute shaders to provide a very
simple raytraced image
